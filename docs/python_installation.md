###Setting up the Virtual Environment

You will need to install and be running on virtualenv. 

**Pycharm users**:
* Pycharm makes the handling of virtual environments easy and has a setup tool built in.
    1. From a **new** project:
        1. Open a ```New Project``` in Pycharm
        1. It has near the top, there is a "Interpreter" field. Click on the gear on the right and select ```Create 
            VirtualEnv```.  
        1. Now name your virtual environment, choose where you want it stored (Keep it out of project root directory) 
            and point the interpreter to the python.exe you have installed.
        1. Click ```Okay``` and your virtual environment will be created with new project.
    1. From an **existing** project:
        1. Select ```File/Settings/Project:name/Project Interpreter```. Click the gear icon to the right of "Project
            Interpreter" then select ```Create VirtualEnv```.
        1. Now name your virtual environment, choose where you want it stored (Keep it out of project root directory) 
            and point the interpreter to the python.exe you have installed.
        1. Click ```Okay``` and your virtual environment will be created.
        1. Open the Terminal and you should see your named virtual environment in brackets before the directory. This
            indicates the virtual environment you are working on. Always work on your environment when developing.  
            
**Non-Pycharm users**:  

We can use pip, which is already pre-packaged with Python. Pip is a handler for downloading and installing packages.  

Using cmd.exe
1. Check that you have pip installed by typing: ```pip -V```. It should show you the version number and directory it's 
    from.
1. Install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/), use this command: 
```pip install virtualenv==X.X.X```.
1. install [virtualenvwrapper-win](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) by typing
```pip install virtualenvwrapper-win```. This will save from typing long repetitive command lines for virtualenv.
* Setup a virtual environment by following this manual: 
[virtualenvwrapper-win](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)  
![creating Virtual Environments](/docs/images/creating_virtual_env.png)  

    * Now it is set up where you need to activate the virtual environment, type ````workon```` then the name of the 
    environment. If you need to quit the environment, type ````deactivate````.
