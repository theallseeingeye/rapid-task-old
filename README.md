### Important Notes Before Starting...
* [Editing these documents?](#editing-these-documents)  
**Pycharm users**: Install the "Markdown Support" plugin by Jetbrains. This provides a live preview of the .md documents.
*Note:* .md Links and indexes do not work in Pycharm, but does in GitHub.

# Installation 
First time setup will need to follow the installation documentation:
[Windows Installation](/docs/installation_windows.md) or [OS X Installation](/docs/installation_osx.md)


# Development Mode <a id="developmentmode"></a>

Backend
-------
During development the local, testing, staging and production settings will be different. This is due ease of developing
on localhosts and requires different setup from production servers. You will need to make sure you are working in the
right settings at the appropriate stage of the development. Here are the **command lines** to set the right settings 
when you are running server:
* Local: ```python manage.py runserver --settings=config.settings.local```  
* Test: ```python manage.py runserver --settings=config.settings.test```  
* Staging: ```python manage.py runserver --settings=config.settings.staging ``` 
* Production: ```python manage.py runserver --settings=config.settings.production```  
    *Note: Look at the notes after you run server to ensure you are using the right settings path.*   
     
Downloading requirements files:
* When you modify or adjust dependencies for the project, we use the following **command lines**:  
  * Local: ```pip install -r requirements/local.txt```
  * Test: ```pip install -r requirements/test.txt```
  * Staging: ```pip install -r requirements/staging.txt```
  * Production: ```pip install -r requirements/production.txt```
  
Updating to the requirement files:
* Ensure they are requirements that are used- not cluttered with junk
   * In command line in your virtual environment: pip freeze > requirements/local.txt
      * Can replace local.txt with other versions such as test, staging and production.

#### Running Backend Server
* Make sure you are in the backend project folder. The root is /backend.
    * Terminal command: ```python manage.py runserver```  

Frontend 
--------

#### Running Frontend Server
* Make sure you are not in an virtual environment. If you are, type ```deactivate``` in the terminal.
* Check that you are in the frontend project folder directory. The root is /frontend.
* Then use this command to start the server:
    * Terminal command: ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

# Appendix

#### Editing these documents? <a id="editingthesedocuments"></a>

These documents MUST follow these simple syntax rules to retain it's formatting for users to easily read. It uses the
"Markdown" or ".md" formats, or more specifically, "GitHub Flavored Markdown". Markdown provides us a simple syntax 
formatter to build the documentation and can easily be converted into html.  

Markdown guides at these links:
* Github's Standards We Follow: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/   
* Markdown Manual: http://markdown-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html  
* Markdown Tutorial: http://tylingsoft.com/tutorial.md/#whats-markdown

**Pycharm users** have an option to download a Markdown Viewer. The internal links and interactive functions will not 
work, but still works on GitHub. Install by using Pycharm following: ```file/settings/editor/plugins```. Then find 
"Markdown Support" by IntelliJ products and install it.
